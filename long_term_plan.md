We have 4 modes
- Single Player
- High Score (mp)
- Race (mp)
- Land grab (mp)

We have 1 plugin
- GeoQuiz

The one plugin we have implements all 4 modes

In future I want there to be an easy set up to 
- Add new modes
- Add new plugins

Where a plugin does not have to implement every mode

Example of a new plugin could be "Name the flags"

Can we make sure that the current structure of the code is good to support all of that?


If not, make a plan in plan.md for how to restructure the code to suppoort all that
